# PTE - Parallel Programming II. - Homework 2.
Find solutions for 21 peg puzzle

The puzzle has 21 holes Like in the figure. Initially every hole is filled with a peg, except for the
center hole. Pegs are moved and removed by doing a hopping. A hop is allowed in a straight line
(horizontal, vertical or diagonal) from its hole over an occupied hole to an empty hole on the other
side. The peg is removed from the occupied hole. The object of the puzzle is to remove all pegs
until only one peg remains in the center hole. (Theoretically 19 moves – hops – is necessary to
reduce the original 20 pegs to a single peg
Write a program to find a solution to this puzzle.

The program should read the initial table from an input file 

```
  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
0 | - | X | X | X | - 
1 | X | X | X | X | X 
2 | X | X | O | X | X
3 | X | X | X | X | X
4 | - | X | X | X | -

  X = peg
  O = empty hole
  - = space that cannot be used.
```

Usage:
```
Usage: 	pte_parallel_programming_II_21_peg_puzzle -i table.txt -o solutions.txt -c 1000
    -i	path to the source input file which contains the table.
The file should contain an n x n table, with the following symbols:
X = peg
O = empty hole
- = space, that cannot be used
-o	path to the output data file
The file should be ended with a new line.
PLAIN TEXT file with the possible solutions
-c	count of the required solutions
```

Measured results:
> Start: Tuesday, 13:30\
> Finish with the first quarter: Friday, ~01:30\
> 81250 million count of winner moves from 934727388988 checked moves

We have to mention, that this measurement checks only the steps which has the same origin step. In this case, from 0,2 to 2,2.

But - as the table is symmetric - it's enough for us to check just one starting point, as all the other steps origins from other location can be generated by some matrix transformation.
